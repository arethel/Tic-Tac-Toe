# Comparison of random and minimax algorithms
## (from left to right 0 to 8 taken squares in ms)
## Random :
[0.006291, 0.006049, 0.005812, 0.005895, 0.006094, 0.006074, 0.006164, 0.0059, 0.00558]

It mostly remains the same because it just takes random cells
## Minimax :
[6977.61376, 596.043502, 96.862323, 10.512752, 1.149090, 0.348722, 0.097040, 0.023331, 0.010192]

It becomes faster because it needs less models to predict the best move out of all possible moves
